  (Please excuse the video shakiness and iPhone 6s quality) After some time and patience, and a lot of convincing my parents, I was able to go to Japan last year! It was one of the best decisions I've ever made and was worth every single penny. I got to wear a yukata and eat melon pan for the first time which was pretty awesome. It was fun bouncing from hotel to hotel, rooming with my friends, sleeping in futons, trying new Kit Kat flavors, and climbing 3000 feet up a mountain in a gondola. It is not shown in the montage but before going home, we landed in Seattle, WA and toured for a couple of hours. It was pretty exciting to see the Space Needle and visit the first ever Starbucks in the Pike Place Market.
