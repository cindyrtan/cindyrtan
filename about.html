      <div id="bio"><big>Hi there! I'm <span class="border-highlight">Cindy Tran</span>, a digital media artist and student at San Jose State University majoring in Digital Media Art with a minor in Interaction Design.</big>
      <br><br>
      I enjoy exploring new ways to approach art. Although most of my previous works were within the realm of traditional art (i.e watercolor and mixed media), I found myself experimenting and adoring digital art softwares like Adobe Photoshop and Dimension. My art style is a bit arbitrary but I have noticed that my works are expanding beyond photography, video, and digital composition.<span id="dots">..</span>

      <div class="a"><span class="realistic-marker-highlight">Art was a big part of my life growing up,</span></div> as I recall drawing and doodling just about anywhere at any time. I drew on my parents’ bathroom wall, my own bedroom wall, and just about any blank space I could find, including the back of my tests and homework assignments, in which I did get in trouble for a couple of times. When I was very young, my parents did a zhua zhou for me and my older sister. For context, zhua zhou (抓週) is an Asian ritual where the parents place various objects before a child in which their choice of object may symbolize certain career choices or personality traits. Based on my parents, I had either picked up a pencil or paintbrush. Although I had thought of the ritual as nothing more than superstition, I later noticed that I was growing attached to art. Majority of my possessions growing up were hand-me-downs and items from the clearance section. This also included children’s toys in which I had virtually none that I could call my own except for some stuffed animals and dolls from toy drives. As a young child, not having the latest toy or doll sometimes felt isolating but I was able to find some comfort in art where a sheet of paper and pencil could take my child-self anywhere. I was able to get lost in my own imagination by creating stories, whether it was saving a princess from a cyclops or becoming a fairy that cleans the planet. Besides drawing and doodling, when my family got a computer, my sister and I were super excited to play free online games and MMOs like Fantage, Pixie Hollow, and Zynga games from Facebook, just to name a few. Interacting with these games brought me so much joy and made me realize how there are so many ways to incorporate art and technology into our lives. With the rise of technology and innovation, I learned that I could do so much more beyond traditional art which urged me to pursue a career that combines art and technology.
      <br><br>
      In order for me to take proper strides towards that goal, I had to expand my knowledge and abilities beyond traditional art, and challenge myself to learn and maneuver around certain softwares. As a self-taught artist, I had no specialized knowledge or skills, but my creativity and curiosity helped me to persist despite the challenges and inspired me to enjoy the unknown complexity of new media art. Although my current skills and studies vary across a spectrum, I have been enjoying the experimental and exploratory process of using new techniques and mediums, such as coding, 3D modeling, web designing and creating digital image compositions. The knowledge and skills I have been able to attain from my instructors, allowed me to be in a position where I am able to research, problem-solve, and eventually advance my artistic abilities moving forward. I aspire to pursue a career that merges art and technology with other subjects I am interested in such as education, psychology, and/or business. It was tough being told most of my life that art will not change the world or save lives. With such narrow-minded beliefs, I aim to show the world the beauty, the flaws, and the true realities of our world in the form of art. Art reaches far beyond a flat canvas, holding universal truths, and ignites immersive and interactive experiences that simply cannot be defined in a singular form.
